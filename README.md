# GameBackbone
GameBackbone (GB) is a small, low-level, library meant to accelerate the
production of 2D video games. GB provides little to no gameplay logic and is
simply meant to help remove long overhead times when starting a new 2D game.
This narrow scope allows GB to maintain high performance and allows users of
GB to maintain total control over their codebase.
<br>
<br>
A good understanding of C++ is required to make use of GB. Game developers
who want to quickly make a game without a background in software development
should look into other solutions.
